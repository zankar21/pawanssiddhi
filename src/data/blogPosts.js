IoT sensors are revolutionizing industrial maintenance by providing real-time insights into equipment health. Below are some of the top sensors used today:

1. **Vibration Sensors**: Detect early-stage bearing and alignment issues. Ideal for motors, pumps, and compressors, they reduce unplanned downtime by up to 30%.

2. **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor thermal hotspots in electrical panels, motors, and boilers. Alerts prevent overheating and fires, improving safety and energy efficiency.

3. **Pressure Transducers**: Ensure fluid and gas systems operate within safe limits. Rapid leak detection protects against catastrophic failures in pipelines and reactors.

4. **Humidity & Gas Sensors**: Track environmental conditions—humidity, toxic gases, and VOCs—in confined spaces and clean rooms. Essential for worker safety and product quality.

5. **Magnetic Field Sensors**: Non-intrusive condition monitoring of rotating shafts and couplings. Identify imbalance and misalignment before mechanical damage.

6. **Level Sensors**: Ultrasonic and radar-based technologies for liquid level measurement in tanks and silos. Automate refill cycles and prevent overflows.

7. **Flow Meters**: Clamp-on and inline devices measure liquid and gas flow rates. Optimize process throughput and detect blockages in real time.

Each of these sensors integrates with our Maintenance Hawkeye platform, providing predictive analytics and customizable dashboards to keep your operations running smoothly.`,
